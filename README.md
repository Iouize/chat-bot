# Chatbot
Brief Deep Learning "plug-and-play"

This is a chatbot using https://huggingface.co/facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill

## Installation

You need to deploy locally the main.py using the following command :

*uvicorn main:app --reload*
    
The app may not work if it isn't deploy either, the vscode extension "live server" works fine
